The [www.regioninnovation.org](https://www.regioninnovation.org) platform addresses the need to foster science and innovation in regional areas, which often lack the focus and investment seen in urban centers. This platform aims to unlock the untapped potential of these regions, characterized by unique ecosystems, industries, and cultures, which can significantly contribute to advancements and growth.

Here's an outline of the specific needs the platform covers:

* **Identifying and Matching R&D Activities**: The platform identifies and matches research and development (R&D) activities within regional areas and between regional and urban centers. This helps to foster collaboration and innovation by connecting local and remote capabilities.

* **Stimulating Investment**: By supporting the identification of R&D activities and capabilities, the platform aims to stimulate investment to and from regional areas. This can help drive economic growth in these regions.

* **Providing Comprehensive Data**: The platform offers a Geographic Information System (GIS) that locates scientific and innovative organisations and teams using data from papers and patents. Additional information, such as health services, is also available to improve linkages with local capabilities.

* **Addressing Regional Challenges**: Science and innovation can provide targeted solutions to regional challenges, such as environmental issues and health disparities. The platform can help to connect researchers and innovators with these challenges, leading to the development of new technologies and sustainable strategies.

* **Reducing Brain Drain**: By bringing science and innovation to less urbanised regions, the platform opens up new educational opportunities for local communities. This can help to reduce the "brain drain" phenomenon, where talented individuals leave their hometowns for better opportunities elsewhere.

* **Promoting Inclusive Development**: The platform promotes a more inclusive approach to development by ensuring that all communities have the opportunity to contribute to and benefit from scientific and technological advancements.
