The Lens is the flagship project of the social enterprise, [Cambia](https://cambia.org/), which seeks to source, merge and link diverse open knowledge sets, including scholarly works and patents, to inform discovery, analysis, decision making and partnering on a human-centered user experience built on an open web platform, [Lens.org](https://www.lens.org/). With over 20 years of development, supported by prominent philanthropic organisations, The Lens ingests, cleans, aggregates, normalises and serves over 272+ million scholarly works, 155+ million global patent records, and more than 495+ million patent sequences, with rich metadata drawn from diverse data sources. The Lens architecture is built around the Lens MetaRecord. ‘Knowledge artefacts’ – including scholarly works and patents, exist in a constellation of forms, timelines, degrees of access and quality. By integrating multiple identifiers and sources to provide an open MetaRecord, the best metadata can be assembled, normalized and exposed, while maintaining provenance and linkages.

Lens scholarly works [MetaRecords](https://about.lens.org/the-lens-metarecord/) include the following primary data sources:  Crossref, PubMed, OpenAlex and Microsoft Academic (discontinued), with supplementary data from additional data sources including Unpaywall, OpenCitations, DOAJ, ORCID, ROR, PMC, Retraction Watch and publishers such as Springer Nature. You can read more about our data set on the data set tab of the structure search page, which includes the date the data set was last updated. The scholarly data is updated every two weeks.
