Science and innovation often focus on urban centers, overlooking the untapped potential in regional areas. These regions offer unique ecosystems, industries, and cultures that can significantly contribute to advancements and growth. 

Science Data Nexus is developing a platform to identify and match R&D activities between regional and urban areas, fostering collaboration and innovation. The platform will use Open Data and feature an AI engine for classifying needs with relevant R&D capabilities. 

Target users include regional governments, stakeholders, economic development agencies, federal governments, and regional hubs of larger research and higher education organizations. 

The platform, to be made available at [www.regioninnovation.org](https://www.regioninnovation.org), will offer free access with limited authentication. Key deliverables include POC for regional Victoria and Queensland, publication and patent data, and research link data by June 2025, with further enhancements by December 2025.
