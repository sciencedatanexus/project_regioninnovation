Impact refers to long-term outcomes that result in system-level change. It involves the process by which end users, such as individuals, firms, and organisations, are convinced to adopt and continue using a technology or innovation. 

Impact encompasses the results of research and development (R&D) efforts that lead to the enhancement of manufacturing processes, product quality, or a deeper understanding of the effects of products, services, or policies. For example, this could include improving production techniques or evaluating the outcomes of health interventions through clinical trials. Achieving impact requires whose staff and knowledge from universities and research organisations to advance or package information about technologies and markets.
 
This knowledge must be made available, accessible, and implementable for real-world use. At the same time, firms need to be prepared to finance, produce, distribute, and maintain new technologies or processes. Additionally, government agencies at all levels—federal, state, and local—play a key role in supporting the adoption of innovations through public policies and programs. Impact, therefore, is a collective effort involving research, industry, and policy to drive meaningful and sustained change.
