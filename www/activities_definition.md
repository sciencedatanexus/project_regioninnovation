Activities refer to the implementation of basic (or frontier) and applied research that supports a scientific capacity. They cover experimental or theoretical work conducted with the goal of gaining new knowledge about the fundamental principles of phenomena and observable facts, without an immediate focus on practical applications. This includes activities that are more targeted, focusing on acquiring new knowledge that is directly linked to a specific practical goal or objective. 

The base element to capture a research activity is a project. Some initiatives exist to identify these project globally (see [ardc.edu.au/services/ardc-identifier-services/raid-research-activity-identifier-service](https://ardc.edu.au/services/ardc-identifier-services/raid-research-activity-identifier-service/) for an example, as well as in commercial databases), they are generally captured at the funder level.
