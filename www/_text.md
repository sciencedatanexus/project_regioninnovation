The first question to ask when describing elements of a research and innovation process is to identify “what type” of research is taking place. This involves defining the domain, disciplines, and topics being addressed. To provide context, classification systems, taxonomies or ontologies are often employed, helping to categorise and organise the elements under study. Additionally, the question of “what” extends to the types of documents or activities used to evaluate these elements. For example, this might include research publications, grant types, or the legal status of patents.
