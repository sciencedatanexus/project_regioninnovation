Outcomes assess the immediate progress made towards desired changes in individuals, organisations, and communities. These outcomes typically arise from the rapid dissemination of knowledge, particularly within scientific and technical communities. Short-term results include the application of existing research and practical experience to develop new materials, products, generic technologies, or devices in the form of prototypes, and their testing in real-world environments. Additionally, this stage includes research aimed at understanding customer needs or improving distribution, sales, and adoption of new innovations.
