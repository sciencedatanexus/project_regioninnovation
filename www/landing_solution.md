The proposed solution by [www.regioninnovation.org](https://www.regioninnovation.org) is the development of an information platform designed to support the identification of R&D activities in regions and R&D capabilities in close urban centers, accessible at [www.regioninnovation.org](https://www.regioninnovation.org). The platform aims to stimulate investment to and from regional areas by matching local and remote capabilities to drive collaborations, transfer technology and knowledge, create synergy, and identify critical mass.

Here's a breakdown of the platform's key features and functionalities:
* **Geographic Information System (GIS)**: The platform will feature a GIS that locates scientific organizations and teams active in both scientific publications and patents. Additional information, such as health services, will be available to improve linkages with local capabilities.

* **AI Engine**: An AI engine will classify technology or scientific needs with the relevant R&D capability, even using "plain English queries".

* **Open Data**: The platform will use Open Data as its backbone, ensuring transparency, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness. It enhances local aspects (e.g., locations, integration) while linking to the original source for comprehensive information.

* **Matching**: The platform will identify and match R&D activities within regional areas and between regional and urban areas, fostering collaboration and innovation.

<!--**Versions**: Version 0.9 is slated to include a Proof of Concept (POC) for regional Victoria, publication and patent data, and research link data. Version 1.0 will add AURIN data, digital twin integration, and inclusion of other states.) -->

* **Free Access**: The platform offers free access with limited authentication to enable specific searches or saved reports.

The platform is designed to serve various users, including local communities, regional governments, stakeholders, economic development agencies, federal governments, and regional hubs of larger research and higher education organisations. Science Data Nexus aims to provide affordable, high-quality software solutions tailored to the needs of commercial or non-profit organizations, enhancing operational efficiency, data management, and collaboration.
