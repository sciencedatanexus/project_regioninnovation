Internationbal collaborations are underpinned by the scientific capabilities in each of the collaborating countries.

Scientific capacity is the foundation of the research and innovation process, encompassing the resources, influences, and inputs that shape the agenda and drive R&D efforts. 

By setting the research agenda, governments or end-users identify key challenges, expand knowledge, and shape future R&D through initiatives like funding calls or collaborative planning. 

Capacity includes the existing scientific (knowledge) base, as well as essential R&D infrastructure such as facilities like linear accelerators or tools like spectroscopy and genome mapping techniques. It also relies on a skilled and educated R&D workforce, supported by networks of researchers, often referred to as communities of practice.
