**Which organisations**

Collaborations in a research team is a collection of people who are organised as a whole, combining their efforts to achieve a common objective, namely discovering something new through research by sharing information, resources, and expertise.
We use the co-authorship as the measure of collaboration in a team. A team is therefore a collection of identified researchers who co-author papers. 

This definition includes teams of two or more researchers. In addition to this definition, only the smaller teams are counted when 20 or less co-authors contribute to the research. This follows methodology from :

- *Bilateral and Multilateral Coauthorship and Citation Impact: Patterns in UK and US International Collaboration. Adams,Jonathan; Gurney,Karen A. Frontiers in Research Metrics and Analytics, 2018.* [10.3389/frma.2018.00012](https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/frma.2018.00012)

**Number of collaborations**: this is the total number of co-authorships between two distinct organisations using a fractional count of each collaboration on individual publications. For instance, on a publication with three authors from distinct organisations, each collaboration is counted as 1/3. Only organisations with a number of collaboration of 1.0 and above are presented for clarity purpose.
